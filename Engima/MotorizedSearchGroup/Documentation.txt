--- ENGIMA'S MOTORIZED SEARCH GROUP (VER 1.00) ---

Engima's Motorized Search Group is a script that controls a search patrol using an armored (or any) vehicle. The group
moves to and searches a marker area for enemies, attacking on contact.

When it arrives at the search marker, the cargo units disembark and form a line with the vehicle and start the search
randomly across the search area. If the distance from one destination point to another is far, the units will embark,
but if it's close the units will move by foot. Area may be of any size, and vehicle must have cargo slots for all group
members excluding crew.

If search area marker does not exist, the group will do nothing. If it starts to exist, the group will start moving. If
search area marker moves, group will mount and travel to marker's new position.

Script works in singleplayer, multiplayer, hosted, dedicated and for JIPs.


--- INSTRUCTIONS ---

Any vehicle with cargo slots, and any infantry unit, can be used.

1. Place the vehicle of any side on the map. Vehicle needs empty cargo slots, and should contain crew.
2. Place infantry units beside the vehicle and make sure they are in the same group as the vehicle.
3. Place a marker on the map to define a search area. Marker must be of a shape (not an icon) with any size. Name it 
   e.g. "SearchAreaMarker".
4. Add the following line to the init field of the vehicle:

_nil = [this, "SearchAreaMarker"] execVM "Engima\MotorizedSearchGroup\MotorizedSearchGroup.sqf";
