----------------------------------------------
 - ENGIMA'S PATROLLED AREAS (VERSION 1.1) -
----------------------------------------------

Script that provides a simple way to dynamically populate areas with patrolling units. Units spawn into 
presence when players are near, and is deleted when they go away. Script is customizable.


--- VERSION HISTORY ---

1.1:     Added callbacks ON_GROUP_CREATED and ON_GROUP_REMOVING.
         Added start parameter HIDE_MARKERS with default value true.
         Added support for headless client.
1.0.02:  Created better default config.
1.0.01:  Fixed: Debug flag accidently set to true.
1.0:     Fixed: Groups sometimes spawn in water.
0.91.10: Fixed: "Area per group" was calculated incorrectly.
0.91.01: Added debug asserts for unit class names that do not exist.
0.91:    Fixed package that contains too many files.
0.90:    First version.


--- CUSTOMIZATION ---

1. Place markers on the map where you want units to be patrolling. Markers may be of any shape and 
   direction, but not icons.
2. Customize parameters in file "Engima\PatrolledAreas\ConfigAndStart.sqf, for desired behaviour."
3. Play.

Script gets executed automatically since an initialization line is added to mission's init.sqf file.
You may also execute several instances of the script if you want areas patrolled with different setup. 
E.g. some areas patrolled by west and some patrolled by east. Simply copy the function call from file 
ConfigAndStart.sqf and call the function with different parameters.

Cusomization Parameters
The start parameter list is an array of named parameters. The list is be customizable for desired 
behavior of the spawned units.

// Start script
_parameters call PATAREAS_PatrolledAreas;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PATROL_AREAS (Array):
Array of areas (marker names) that will be patrolled. Default value is ["PatrolledAreas_Marker1", "PatrolledAreas_Marker2"].
Change and complete this array with your own markers.

HIDE_MARKERS (Boolean):
Whether the patrol area markers will be hidden by the script or not. If true the markers will be hidden
(setMarkerAlpha 0), if false they will not be affected by the script at all.

UNIT_CLASSES (Array):
Array of possible units (class names) that will be spawned. If you want one unit class to be more probable 
than another, it some extra times in the array.
Default value are some Arma 3 Opfor units.

SIDE (Side):
Side of spawned units.

MIN_UNITS_PER_GROUP (Scalar):
Minimum numbers of units in a group. Must be less than or equal to MAX_UNITS_PER_GROUP. Units per group 
will be a random number between MIN_UNITS_PER_GROUP and MAX_UNITS_PER_GROUP.

MAX_UNITS_PER_GROUP (Scalar):
Maximum numbers of units in a group. Must be greater than or equal to MIN_UNITS_PER_GROUP. Units per group 
will be a random number between MIN_UNITS_PER_GROUP and MAX_UNITS_PER_GROUP.

SPAWN_DISTANCE (Scalar):
If a player gets closer than this distance to an area marker, search patrol units will spawn.

AREA_PER_GROUP (Scalar):
Density of patrolling groups in an area (in unit "square meters per group").
If area is less than this area then 1 group will be spawned.
If area is greater than this area but less than double this area, then 1 group will spawn.
If area is greater than double this area but less than triple this area, then 2 groups will spawn, and
so on.

GROUP_PROBABILITY_OF_PRESENCE (Scalar):
Each group's probability of presence. Must be a value between 0 and 1. 0 = group will never be present, 
1 = group will always be present, 0.5 = each group has a 50% chance to be present.

MIN_SKILL (Scalar):
Minimum skill of each spawned unit. Must be greater or equal to 0 and less than or equal to MAX_SKILL. 
Skill will be a random number between MIN_SKILL and MAX_SKILL.

ON_GROUP_CREATED (Code):
A callback that is executed right after a group has spawned. Parameter _this is an array and contains 
the following sent in parameters: 0 (Group): The group that was spawned. 1 (String): The marker in which
the group was spawned. 2 (Scalar): The total number of groups spawned in the current marker.
Example: { hint "Group spawned in marker " + (_this select 1) + "!"; }

ON_GROUP_REMOVING (Code):
A callback that is executed right before an ambient infantry group is removed. Parameter _this is an array 
and contains the following sent in parameters: 0 (Group): The group that will be removed. 1 (String): The 
marker in which the group was spawned. 2 (Scalar): The total number of groups spawned in the current marker.
Example: { hint "Group was removed."; }

DEBUG (Boolean):
Whether debug info will be printed or not. true if you want debug information for groups (dots on the 
map), otherwise false.
