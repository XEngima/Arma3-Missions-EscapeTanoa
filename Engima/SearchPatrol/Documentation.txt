--------------------------------------------
 - ENGIMA'S SEARCH PATROL (VERSION 1.21) -
--------------------------------------------

Script that adds search patrol behavior to a group of AI soldiers. The group will patrol an area (marker), 
and when it encounters enemies it will engage.


--- VERSION HISTORY ---

1.21:    Fixed: Script can now be executed on a headless client.
         Fixed: Script now exits by itself if the group is suddenly removed.
1.20:    Fixed: Groups getting destination positions in water.
         Fixed: Groups engaging flying enemy units.
1.11:    Fixed: Script error when units die or are being removed.
1.10.01: Fixed: Hardcoded unit bug.
1.10:    Units are more active in looking around when moving.
1.0.10:  Group will now always walk between patrol positions, no matter how far it is between them, which will give them a more natural behavior in large areas (markers).
1.0:     First version.


--- SETTING IT UP ---

1. Add the AI patrol group on the map.
2. Add a marker on the map, covering the patrol area, and name it (e.g. "marker"). The marker may be of any shape (but not an icon).
3. Add the following line to the initializtion of the leader:

  _nil = [group this, "marker", [0,0,0], true] execVM "Engima\SearchPatrol\SearchPatrol.sqf";
  
  Note that the name of the marker (in the example "marker") must be the correct name of the marker.


--- EXAMPLES ---

A search patrol patrolling the marker named "patrol_marker" randomly and from a random starting position:

  _nil = [group this, "patrol_marker"]

A search patrol patrolling the marker, starting on a specific position:

  _nil = [group this, "patrol_marker", getMarkerPos "start_marker"]
  
A search patrol patrolling the marker, starting on a random position, and in debug mode:

  _nil = [group this, "patrol_marker", [0,0,0], true]
